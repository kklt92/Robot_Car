Robot_Car
=========

Robot car code for 2nd year university project

The 0.44 can work well and run smoothly.


The 0.73 is for the final race and get the 4th in the match.

The delay can be changed less than the number which use in 0.73 version. But I don't have enough time to test it.

In fact the delay variable depends on the weight of the car.


====================================================================================

The specification of the project:

1. Car should follow the black line
2. Car needs to carry an egg and the egg is not allowed to fall down.
===================================================================================

The detail of design:
1. This code is designed to use the stepper motor.
2. The algorithm for input from optic sensors is well work for both stepper or DC motor.
